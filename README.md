Zero-Trust Octagon is a comprehensive, vendor-neutral reference textbook that defines zero-trust through **eight irreducible axioms** (the Octagon), evaluates architectures through a **nine-dimension morphological matrix**, and provides **actionable implementation pathways** for organizations of every scale.

## What's Inside

**The Octagon** — Eight axioms that form the mathematical invariant core of zero-trust. Any architecture failing one is not zero-trust.

1. **No Intrinsic Trust** — Trust is a transient verdict, never a property
2. **Explicit, Verifiable Policy** — Policy must be deterministic, replayable, non-contradictory
3. **Unbypassable Mediation** — No path between subject and object escapes evaluation
4. **Continuous Verification** — Verification is ongoing, not gated at session establishment
5. **Deterministic Bounded Authority** — Every action carries a context-limited, proof-backed credential
6. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance** — Trust is computed as consensus across a set of verifiers
7. **Epistemic Integrity** — Distinguish cryptographically provable fact from policy-derived inference
8. **Bilateral Symmetry** — Protect data flowing in both directions, not just outbound

**The Morphological Matrix** — A 9-dimension configuration space (trust anchors, identity models, enforcement layers, attestation modalities, violation responses, policy distribution, observability trust, organizational posture, human continuity) replacing linear maturity models.

**Four Archetypes with Attack Traces** — Full breach narratives against each archetype (Holy Grail, Fortune 500, Startup, Lean Defense) with cross-trace synthesis.

**Implementation Trees** — 24-month, 12-month, and 6-month roadmaps with gate checks, cost estimates, and failure pivots.

## Who This Is For

- Security architects designing zero-trust deployments
- SREs responsible for making security models survive production
- Security engineers evaluating detection stacks against first principles
- Technical leaders who need to understand why vendor suites still get breached

**Prerequisites:** Working knowledge of cloud-native infrastructure (containers, orchestration, service mesh) and basic cryptographic primitives (TLS, JWT, PKI).
