## 1. Introduction

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) leads the nation’s effort to understand,
manage, and reduce cybersecurity risk, including by supporting Federal Civilian Executive Branch
agencies in evolving and operationalizing cybersecurity programs and capabilities. CISA’s Zero Trust
Maturity Model (ZTMM) provides an approach to achieve continued modernization efforts related to zero
trust within a rapidly evolving environment and technology landscape. This ZTMM is one of many paths
that an organization can take in designing and implementing their transition plan to zero trust
architectures in accordance with Executive Order (EO) 14028 “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity” §
(3)(b)(ii),^1 which requires that agencies develop a plan to implement a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA).
While the ZTMM is specifically tailored for federal agencies as required by EO 14028, all organizations
should review and consider adoption of the approaches outlined in this document.

## 2. Current Environment

Recent cyber incidents2, 3 have highlighted the broad challenges of ensuring effective cybersecurity across
the federal government, as with many large enterprises, and demonstrate that “business as usual”
approaches are no longer sufficient to defend the nation from cyber threats. In leading the national effort
to understand, manage, and reduce cyber risks, CISA must meet new challenges to safeguard the federal
civilian executive branch using a clear, actionable, and risk-informed approach. Adequate cyber defense
against emerging threats requires increased speed and agility to outpace adversaries by substantially
increasing costs to threat actors and improving durability and resiliency to quickly recover to full
operational capability.

CISA’s cybersecurity mission is to defend and secure cyberspace by leading national efforts to drive and
enable effective national cyber defense, enhance resilience of national critical functions, and advance a
robust technology ecosystem. CISA plays a critical role in maintaining cyber situational awareness across
FCEB agencies; securing the .gov domain; and aiding federal civilian agencies, critical infrastructure
owners and operators, as well as industry partners in managing major cyber incidents. While CISA
maintains capabilities to defend against and mitigate known or suspected cyber threats, an evolving threat
landscape and the adoption of new and emerging technologies pose challenges.

EO 14028 marked a renewed commitment to and prioritization of federal cybersecurity modernization.
Among other policy mandates, EO 14028 embraced zero trust as the desired security model for the
federal government and called for FCEB agencies to develop plans to implement ZTAs. A typical plan
will assess an agency’s current cybersecurity state and plan for a fully implemented ZTA. As the lead
agency on federal cybersecurity and risk reduction, CISA’s ZTMM assists agencies in development of
their zero trust strategies and continued evolution of their implementation plans and presents ways in
which various CISA services can support zero trust solutions across agencies.

OMB Memorandum M-22-09, “Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity
Principles,”^4 detailed specific actions for federal agencies to adopt in alignment with the pillars outlined
in the ZTMM. This memorandum sets forth a Federal ZTA strategy, requiring agencies to meet
cybersecurity objectives by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 to reinforce FCEB defense. CISA revised
the ZTMM to further align with M-22-09’s direction for agencies. FCEB agencies should review this
memo in parallel with developing and implementing their zero trust strategies.

## 3. What Is Zero Trust?

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-207 provides
the following zero trust and ZTA operative definition:

```
Zero trust provides a collection of concepts and ideas designed to minimize
uncertainty in enforcing accurate, least privilege per-request access decisions in
information systems and services in the face of a network viewed as compromised.
ZTA i s an enterprise’s cybersecurity plan that uses zero trust concepts and
encompasses component relationships, workflow planning, and access policies.
Therefore, a zero trust enterprise is the network infrastructure (physical and virtual)
and operational policies that are in place for an enterprise as a product of a ZTA plan.^5
```
SP 800-207 emphasizes that the goal of ZT is to “prevent unauthorized access to data and services
coupled with making the access control enforcement as granular as possible.” Similarly, the National
Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) describes Zero Trust as “a cybersecurity
strategy premised on the idea that no user or asset is to be implicitly trusted. It assumes that a breach has
already occurred or will occur, and therefore, a user should not be granted access to sensitive information
by a single verification done at the enterprise perimeter. Instead, each user, device, application, and
transaction must be continually verified.”^6 Zero trust presents a shift from a location-centric model to an
identity, context, and data-centric approach with fine-grained security controls between users, systems,
applications, data, and assets that change over time; for these reasons, adopting a ZTA is a non-trivial
effort. This shift provides the visibility needed to support the development, implementation, enforcement,
and evolution of security policies. Fundamentally, zero trust may require a change in an organization’s
cybersecurity philosophy and culture.

```
The path to zero trust is an incremental process that may take years to implement.
```
Initially, the implementation of required capabilities and services will often lead to additional costs;
however, in the long-term, zero trust will enable a more prudent allocation of security investments toward

the most critical data and services, rather than “one size fits all” security investments across the entire
enterprise.

## 4. Challenges in Zero Trust Adoption

The Federal Government, as with most large enterprises, faces several challenges in implementing ZTA.
Legacy systems often rely on “implicit trust,” in which access and authorization are infrequently assessed
based on fixed attributes; this conflicts with the core principle of adaptive evaluation of trust within a
ZTA. Existing infrastructures built on implicit trust will require investment to change systems to better
align with zero trust principles. Furthermore, as the technology landscape continues to evolve, new
solutions and continued discussions on how to best achieve zero trust objectives are paramount.

Zero trust adoption requires engagement and cooperation from senior leadership, IT staff, data and system
owners, and users across the Federal Government to effectively achieve design objectives and improve
cybersecurity posture. Modernization of the Federal Government’s cybersecurity will require agencies to
transition stove-piped and siloed IT services and staff to coordinated and collaborative components of a
zero trust strategy, with agency-wide buy in for a common architecture and governance policies. This
includes current and future plans to adopt cloud technologies.^7

Federal agencies are beginning their journeys to zero trust from different starting points. Some agencies
may be further along or better positioned to make these advancements than others; however, regardless of
starting point, successful zero trust adoption can produce numerous benefits such as improved
productivity, enhanced end-user experiences, reduced IT costs, flexible access, and bolstered security.

## 5. Zero Trust Maturity Model

The ZTMM represents a gradient of implementation across five distinct pillars, in which minor
advancements can be made over time toward optimization. The pillars, depicted in Figure 1, include
**Identity** , **Devices** , **Networks** , **Applications and Workloads** , and **Data**. Each pillar includes general
details regarding the following cross-cutting capabilities: _Visibility and Analytics_ , _Automation and
Orchestration_ , and _Governance_.

(^7) Agencies should review CISA’s, United States Digital Services’, and FedRAMP’s jointly authored Cloud Security
Technical Reference Architecture for additional guidance on recommend approaches to cloud migration and data
protection. Cloud Security Technical Reference Architecture v.2 (cisa.gov).


```
Figure 1: Zero Trust Maturity Model Pillars^8
```
```
CISA’s ZTMM is one of many paths to support the transition to zero trust.
```
Various ZTA publications informed the development of this maturity model (see Section 6 for additional
details). This model reflects the seven tenets of zero trust as outlined in NIST SP 800-207:

1. All data sources and computing services are considered resources.
2. All communication is secured regardless of network location.
3. Access to individual enterprise resources is granted on a per-session basis.
4. Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy.
5. The enterprise monitors and measures the integrity and security posture of all owned and
    associated assets.
6. All resource authentication and authorization are dynamic and strictly enforced before access
    is allowed.
7. The enterprise collects as much information as possible about the current state of assets,
    network infrastructure, and communications and uses it to improve its security posture.

As agencies transition towards optimal zero trust implementations, associated solutions increasingly rely
upon automated processes and systems that more fully integrate across pillars and more dynamically
enforce policy decisions. Each pillar can progress at its own pace and may progress more quickly than
others until cross-pillar coordination is required. However, this coordination can only be achieved with
capabilities and dependencies compatible with one another and the enterprise-wide environment. This

Council (IAC) “Zero Trust Cybersecurity Current Trends,” (2019). https://www.actiac.org/system/files/ACT-

allows for and defines a gradual evolution to zero trust, distributing costs over time rather than entirely
upfront.

In alignment with NIST’s steps for transitioning to zero trust, agencies should assess their current
enterprise systems, resources, infrastructure, personnel, and processes before investing in zero trust
capabilities (including for the pillars and functions outlined in this model).^9 This assessment can assist
agencies in identifying existing capabilities to support further zero trust maturity and gaps for
prioritization. Agencies can also plan for opportunities to coordinate capabilities across the pillars to
enable granular, least privilege access controls and mitigate additional risks.^10

The three stages of the ZTM journey that advance from a Traditional starting point to Initial, Advanced,
and Optimal will facilitate federal ZTA implementation. Each subsequent stage requires _greater_ levels of
protection, detail, and complexity for adoption.

## Figure 2: Zero Trust Maturity Journey

As seen in Figure 2, a gencies should expect that required levels of effort and realized benefits will
significantly increase as zero trust maturity progresses across and within pillars. As agencies chart their
ZTA journey, they should explore opportunities to advance pillar maturity to align to specific mission
needs and support further growth across other pillars. Figure 3 highlights the intended agency evolution
over time from a traditional enterprise to a future state that features more dynamic updates, automated
processes, integrated capabilities, and other characteristics of the Optimal stages (as described in the
maturity model). These stages are dynamic and grow exponentially; planned progress from one maturity
stage to another may shift in scope and impact over time.

**Zero Trust Maturity Journey**


## Figure 3: Zero Trust Maturity Evolution

Agencies should use the following guiding criteria of each stage to identify maturity for each zero trust
technology pillar and provide consistency across the maturity model:

- **Traditional** —manually configured lifecycles (i.e., from establishment to decommissioning) and
    assignments of attributes (security and logging); static security policies and solutions that address
    one pillar at a time with discrete dependencies on external systems; least privilege established
    only at provisioning; siloed pillars of policy enforcement; manual response and mitigation
    deployment; and limited correlation of dependencies, logs, and telemetry.
- **Initial** —starting automation of attribute assignment and configuration of lifecycles, policy
    decisions and enforcement, and initial cross-pillar solutions with integration of external systems;
    some responsive changes to least privilege after provisioning; and aggregated visibility for
    internal systems.
- **Advanced** —wherever applicable, automated controls for lifecycle and assignment of
    configurations and policies with cross-pillar coordination; centralized visibility and identity
    control; policy enforcement integrated across pillars; response to pre-defined mitigations; changes
    to least privilege based on risk and posture assessments; and building toward enterprise-wide
    awareness (including externally hosted resources).
- **Optimal** —fully automated, just-in-time lifecycles and assignments of attributes to assets and
    resources that self-report with dynamic policies based on automated/observed triggers; dynamic
    least privilege access (just-enough and within thresholds) for assets and their respective
    dependencies enterprise-wide; cross-pillar interoperability with continuous monitoring; and
    centralized visibility with comprehensive situational awareness.

Figure 4 provides a high-level overview of the ZTMM, including key aspects of the pillar-specific
functions for each pillar and across each maturity stage.


## Figure 4: High-Level Zero Trust Maturity Model Overview

These maturity stages and the details associated with each pillar allow agencies to assess, plan, and
maintain the investments needed to progress toward a ZTA. Subsections 0–5.5 provide high-level
information to support agencies in transitioning to zero trust across the five different pillars: **Identity** ,
**Devices** , **Networks** , **Applications and Workloads** , and **Data**. Each pillar also includes general details
regarding _Visibility and Analytics_ , _Automation and Orchestration_ , and _Governance_ capabilities to support
integration with that pillar and across the model.

These three cross-cutting capabilities highlight activities to support interoperability of functions across
pillars based on the following descriptions:


 **Visibility and Analytics:** Visibility refers to the observable artifacts that result from the

```
characteristics of and events within enterprise-wide environments.^11 The focus on cyber-related data
analysis can help inform policy decisions, facilitate response activities, and build a risk profile to
develop proactive security measures before an incident occurs.^12
```
 **Automation and Orchestration:** Zero trust makes full use of automated tools and workflows that

```
support security response functions across products and services while maintaining oversight,
security, and interaction of the development process for such functions, products, and services.
```
 **Governance:** Governance refers to the definition and associated enforcement of agency cybersecurity
policies, procedures, and processes, within and across pillars, to manage an agency’s enterprise and
mitigate security risks in support of zero trust principles and fulfillment of federal requirements.^13

While the ZTMM covers many aspects of cybersecurity critical to federal enterprises, it does not address
other aspects of cybersecurity such as activities related to incident response, specifics for logging,
monitoring, alerting, forensic analysis, risk acceptance, recovery.^14 O ther aspects of and best practices for
enterprise cybersecurity posture management are not explicitly included within the maturity model
functions. Although the maturity model is not intended to be exclusionary, it does not address challenges
specific to operational technologies,^15 certain classes of internet of things (IoT) devices,^16 or broadly
incorporating emerging technologies such as deception platforms, authenticated web application firewalls,
behavior analytics, etc. Methodologies such as recommendations to best incorporate machine learning and
artificial intelligence capabilities within zero trust solutions are not included in this model. Mature
Agencies should take steps to monitor and assess the performance and integrity of their security
capabilities, underlying infrastructure, and policies to detect unauthorized access and changes as they
mature each pillar. Agencies should be careful to not create new opportunities for exploitation or weaken
security protocols. Research and development are required to effectively assure software and hardware
systems integrity at scale across federal enterprises.17,18,^19

When planning ZTA implementation, agencies should make decisions based on factors which include
risk, mission, federal requirements, and operating constraints. While this model is generally aligned to a
federal enterprise’s single administrative domain or accreditation boundary, agencies should also assess
how their interactions with and reliance upon external partners, stakeholders, and service providers factor
into their ZTA.^20 This maturity model should not be viewed as a strict set of requirements but as a general
guide to help agencies successfully implement their ZTA and adopt an overall improved cybersecurity
posture.

(^20) These considerations span pillars and functions such as trusting credentials, assessing supply chains, differences in
data categorization, policy exceptions, variations in risk thresholds, and more.


### 5.1 Identity

```
An identity refers to an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely describes an agency user or entity, including non-person entities.
```
Agencies should ensure and enforce user and entity access to the right resources at the right time for the right purpose without granting excessive
access. Agencies should integrate identity, credential, and access management solutions where possible throughout their enterprise to enforce
strong authentication, grant tailored context-based authorization, and assess identity risk for agency users and entities. Agencies should integrate
their identity stores and management systems, where appropriate, to enhance awareness of enterprise identities and their associated responsibilities
and authorities.

Governance within the context of identity.

### 5.2 Devices

```
A device refers to any asset (including its hardware, software, firmware, etc.) that can connect to a network, including servers,
desktop and laptop machines, printers, mobile phones, IoT devices, networking equipment, and more.
```
Devices may be agency-owned or bring-your-own-device (BYOD) property of employees, partners, or visitors. Agencies should secure all agency
devices, manage the risks of authorized devices that are not agency-controlled, and prevent unauthorized devices from accessing resources. Device
management includes maintaining a dynamic inventory of all assets including their hardware, software, firmware, etc., along with their
configurations and associated vulnerabilities as they become known.

Many devices present specific ZTA challenges and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as part of a risk-based process. For example,
networking equipment, printers, and others may offer limited options for authentication, visibility, and security. Agencies employing BYOD
policies will likely have fewer options to maintain visibility and control of such devices. The technological landscape for devices continues to
change and as agencies incorporate additional devices into their enterprise, they will need to continue to manage the evolving risks associated with
these devices.^24 In some cases, agencies may be unable to adopt the guidance for certain subsets of their devices. Agencies will also face
challenges in ensuring trusted devices and their services have not reached end-of-life and are still covered by their life-time-support, as legacy
devices often have a higher number of unmitigated vulnerabilities, available misconfigurations, and unknown risks. However, despite these
challenges, agencies should still be able to make considerable progress toward a ZTA.

On-premises computing asset management involves documenting and managing physical assets (devices). As agencies move to cloud
environments, this creates new considerations and opportunities for managing and tracking agency cloud and virtual assets. Cloud assets include
compute resources (e.g., virtual machines, servers, or containers), storage resources (e.g., block storage or file storage), platform assets (e.g.,
databases, web servers, message buses/queues), and network resources (e.g., virtual networks, VPNs, gateways, DNS services, etc.) and virtual
resources associated with other managed cloud services (e.g., artificial intelligence models).

### 5.3 Networks

```
A network refers to an open communications medium including typical channels such as agency internal networks, wireless
networks, and the Internet as well as other potential channels such as cellular and application-level channels used to transport
messages.
```
ZTAs enable a shift away from traditional perimeter-focused approaches to security and permit agencies to manage internal and external traffic
flows, isolate hosts, enforce encryption, segment activity, and enhance enterprise-wide network visibility. ZTAs permit security controls to be
implemented closer to the applications, data, and other resources and augment traditional network-based protections and improve defense-in-
depth. E ach application can be treated uniquely by the network for its demands on access, priority, reachability, connections to dependency
services, and connection pathways. These network application demands can be captured as an application profile, and repeated profiles can then be
treated as a traffic class.

Table 4 lists network functions pertaining to zero trust and the considerations for _Visibility and Analytics_ , _Automation and Orchestration_ , and
_Governance_ within the context of networks.

### 5.4 Applications and Workloads

```
Applications and workloads include agency systems, computer programs, and services that execute on-premises, on mobile
devices, and in cloud environments.
```
Agencies should manage and secure their deployed applications and should ensure secure application delivery. Granular access controls and
integrated threat protections can offer enhanced situational awareness and mitigate application-specific threats. Per OMB M-22-09, agencies
should begin to explore opportunities to make their applications available over public networks to authorized users. Best practices for DevSecOps
and CI/CD processes, including the use of immutable workloads, should also be adopted to the extent possible.30,^31 Agencies should explore
options to shift their operations away from a focus on accreditation boundaries and updating ATOs to supporting applications as if they are
externally facing and provide commensurate security.

### 5.6 Cross-Cutting Capabilities

The cross-cutting capabilities _Visibility and Analytics_ , _Automation and Orchestration_ , and _Governance_ provide opportunities to integrate
advancements across each of the five pillars. As agencies mature these capabilities with respect to a given pillar, they can also mature each
capability independent of the pillars. _Visibility and Analytics_ supports comprehensive visibility that informs policy decisions and facilitates
response activities. _Automation and Orchestration_ capabilities leverage these insights to support robust and streamlined operations to handle
security incidents and respond to events as they arise. _Governance_ enables agencies to manage and monitor their regulatory, legal, environmental,
federal, and operational requirements in support of risk-based decision making. Governance capabilities also ensure the right people, process, and
technology are in place to support mission, risk, and compliance objectives.

Table 7 provides a high-level maturity evolution for each of these cross-cutting capabilities.

This memorandum sets forth a Federal zero trust architecture strategy, requiring agencies to meet specific
cybersecurity standards and objectives by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 in order to reinforce the
Government’s defense against increasingly sophisticated and persistent threat campaigns. The strategy
includes components that place significant emphasis on strong enterprise identity and access controls
(including MFA), require encrypting all network traffic as soon as practicable, support building a
foundation to automate security access rules, and treat every application as internet accessible.

**National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-207**
NIST’s SP 800-207 describes zero trust for enterprise security architects to aid understanding of zero trust
for civilian unclassified systems and provides a road map to migrate and deploy zero trust security
concepts to an enterprise environment. SP 800-207 is the product of a collaboration between multiple
federal agencies and is overseen by the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council. NIST is
developing and releasing additional ZTA implementation guidance.^36

**Department of Defense Zero Trust Reference Architecture**
The Department of Defense (DoD)’s Zero Trust Reference Architecture describes data-centric enterprise
standards and capabilities that can be used to successfully advance the DoD Information Network
(DoDIN) into an interoperable zero trust end state.^37

**National Security Agency Embracing Zero Trust Security Model**
The NSA’s Embracing Zero Trust Security Model explains the benefits and implementation challenges of
a zero trust security model.^38 It discusses the importance of building a detailed strategy, dedicating the
necessary resources, maturing the implementation, and fully committing to the zero trust model to achieve
the desired results. The document’s recommendations will assist cybersecurity leaders, enterprise network
owners, and administrators considering embracing this modern cybersecurity model.

## 7. CISA Resources

CISA programs provide cybersecurity support and guidance across the zero trust pillar areas, including
the integration of the pillars into a ZTA. The following documents are useful resources for agencies
migrating to zero trust. CISA will continue to review and refine these resources as agencies develop
ZTAs and will add additional resources to the collection over time.
